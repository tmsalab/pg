Description: Provides access to a series of highly performant random distribution
    samplers for the Polya Gamma Distribution as described by
    Polson, Scott, and Windle (2013) <arXiv:1205.0310> using either 'C++' headers 
    for 'Rcpp' or 'RcppArmadillo' and 'R'. The 'C++' header approach was developed
    to enable computations in Balamuta (2021) <https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/items/121209>.
